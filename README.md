## a StarWars Role Player Game written with HTML, CSS, JavaScript with JQuery

Pick a Hero and a Foe and do battle.

The game player picks a character from the sideline by clicking on it.  The character selected drops into the "Your Character" division of the screen.  
The game player then selects a character to do battle with.  This character drops into the defender division.

The game player then presses the attack button.  This causes the hero to attack the defender.  In the attack, the hero reduces the defenders health points. When a characters health points are reduce to zero or less than zero, the character dies.  
After the hero's attack, the defender counter-attacks using his counter-attack points to reduce the defender's health points.

When a defender dies, the player can select another foe to do battle with.  

Play contines until either the hero is defeated or all the enemies are vanquished.

At the end of play, the player can restart the game with the restart button.
